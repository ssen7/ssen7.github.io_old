Welcome to my personal blog. 

Here I will talk about my forays into the wide world of data science as I pursue my Masters in Data Science at the wonderful Data Science Institute, University of Virginia. Go Hoos!

I have been part of multiple exciting projects during my time here at UVA and in subsequent posts would try and highlight the challenges I faced and the knowledge gained at the end of each.
