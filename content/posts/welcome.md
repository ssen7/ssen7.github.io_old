Status: published


Welcome to my personal blog. Here I will talk about my forays into the wide world of data science as I pursue my Masters in Data Science at the wonderful Data Science Institute, University of Virginia. Go Hoos!

I have been part of multiple exciting projects during my time here and in subsequent posts would try and highlight the challenges I faced and the knowledge gained at the end of each.

We made a music genre classification model to classify a given song into one of *thirteen* genres. It was a fun way to explore the techniques learnt during SYS 6018 Data Mining, as we could use both text from the lyrics and the numeric properties of each song in the form of frequencies, temp, duration etc.
