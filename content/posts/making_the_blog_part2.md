Summary: Steps for making the website using Pelican and Github.
Status: draft

This is the default theme from Pelican which is fine to look at and achieves most of the stuff you need. I needed a cleaner looking theme though and one that I could customize. Thus, started the hunt for the theme.

### Hunt for the theme

Here are the resources I found after Googling. Maybe you'll find better.

* https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes
* http://www.pelicanthemes.com/

However, none of them seemed to look good to me. The closest one was ['pelican-bootstrap3'](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3) theme. So I turned elsewhere.

I stumbled upon a [blog post](https://www.svenkreiss.com/blog/pelican-2018/) by Sven Kreiss. I liked the website and the fact that both of us are kind of in the same domain. He used a customized theme named 'pure' available [here](https://github.com/svenkreiss/pure).
