<!-- ### Making the blog -->

<!-- ### Reason

Have a place to put up my data science portfolio.

That's it. -->

Me and many other data science enthusiasts who want to showcase their work, need a platform to do it. I needed a platform that is easily updatable, customizable and supports jupyter notebooks. 

Pelican is a python based static site generator that fulfilled all the above criteria. It is open-source, has many plugins that can do things like add support for bibtex, can show jupyter notebooks and a whole lot else. Its also easy to customize without worrying about a lot of front end stuff.

In a series of posts, I will detail the making of this website in the hopes that it might help some of you folks looking to make an easy to use website free of cost.

### Setup your github.io repository on GitHub

On GitHub, create a new repository with the name username.github.io where username is your GitHub username. Do not worry about creating branches or some such. You can do it on your local system.

### Project Setup

Now create a folder where you can store all your website materials. This makes it easy to compartmentalize stuff. I named it **WebApp**.

Inside this folder, open your terminal or command line, whatever you use for running git commands and clone your repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.git
```
Go inside your repository.

```
cd YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
```

Create local branch named 'pelican' where you'll store your pelican configuration files.

```
git checkout -b pelican
```

### Install Pelican and other helper packages

It is always a good idea to use separate environments for projects. I used Anaconda environments. You can use virtualenv also.

```
conda create --name mywebsite
```

Activate this environment.
```
source activate mywebsite
```

Now you can download the packages you need for making this website. PyPI or pip makes this a one step process.

```
pip install pelican markdown ghp-import
```

### You are ready to start!

Use
```
pelican-quickstart
```

Here is a screenshot of what options to choose.

Remember all of this is happening inside your USERNAME.github.io folder that you checked out before.

Also, yes, I am doing all of this using [Ubuntu for Windows](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0)! Nifty little thing they did there.

Your website is almost ready!

### Start building content

Once the quickstart process is complete, there will be a folder called **content** created for you. Create a folder called **posts** inside this folder.

Inside **posts** create a quick markdown file and fill it like the following.

```markdown
Title: Welcome!

Category: welcome

Slug: welcome
Summary: Welcome to my blog where I talk about data minining, machine learning, reinforcement learning and other types of learning.

Welcome to my personal blog!
```

To see how it looks do the following:

```
make html && make serve
```

It should be up on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Publishing to GitHub

Before committing, its good practice to have a .gitignore file in your directory.
My .gitignore looks like this.

```
## ignore files
/output/
/node_modules/
/__pycache__/
```

I'll address the 'node_modules' in a later post.

Use the following commands one after the another to commit all of the generated stuff to GitHub. 
```
git add -A
git commit -m "my first blog"
git push
```

What comes next will blow your mind! 

Using just one command, you can generate a working github.io website.

```
make github
```

It usually takes a little bit of time to show up. But now you have a working website that you can show to others..

Or maybe not. Your choice.

Part 2 will cover adding themes and plugins to your Pelican website.

Stay tuned.
