Summary: Data science and fun!
Status: published

I am Saurav, a software developer by profession and a fascination with how data science is changing the world. Currently I am focusing on specializing in data science.

Working as a software developer has helped me gain skills in building useful and robust systems. Interning at a semi-conductor company has made me appreciate how computers can be used to accomplish complex tasks. 

I am motivated by the idea of building accessible pieces of technology that assist us in our daily lives, by helping us invest smarter, learn better and other myriad of uses. I hope to use the cutting edge of technology to build such systems.

In my free time, I explore ways technology is affecting us as humans. Also, I am into science fiction!
